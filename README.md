# NeuroShield: Multimodal Learning for Neuroprivacy Protection in AI-Driven Brain-Machine Interaction

## Overview
The increasing integration of **AI-driven Brain-Machine Interaction (BMI)** systems has led to growing concerns about **neuroprivacy**. Traditional privacy-preserving methods, such as **differential privacy** and **homomorphic encryption**, often fail to balance **data utility** and **security**, especially in **high-dimensional neural recordings**. Moreover, single-modality protection strategies struggle to prevent **cross-modal privacy leaks** in multimodal BMI systems.

To address these challenges, **NeuroShield** introduces a **multimodal framework** that integrates:
- **Adversarial Representation Learning** to obfuscate sensitive neural information.
- **Contrastive Learning** to disentangle **task-relevant features** from **private attributes**.
- **Privacy-Preserving Neural Decoding** to ensure secure yet effective BMI applications.
- **Adaptive Privacy-Aware Regularization**, dynamically adjusting feature exposure based on privacy sensitivity.

## Key Features
- **Multimodal Privacy Protection**: Secures neural signals across **EEG, fMRI, and other modalities**.
- **Contrastive Learning Mechanism**: Ensures disentanglement of **private vs. task-relevant** information.
- **Adversarial Privacy Shielding**: Prevents **inference attacks** while preserving decoding accuracy.
- **Adaptive Privacy Regularization**: Modulates feature visibility based on privacy sensitivity.
- **High Decoding Accuracy**: Maintains performance while securing neural data.

## Framework Components
### 1. Multimodal Privacy Protection
- Integrates **EEG, fMRI, EMG, and behavioral data**.
- Learns representations that **minimize cross-modal privacy leaks**.

### 2. Adversarial Representation Learning
- Employs adversarial learning to **obfuscate sensitive attributes**.
- Ensures neural features **retain decoding utility** without privacy risks.

### 3. Contrastive Learning for Feature Disentanglement
- Separates **task-relevant** vs. **private** neural representations.
- Enhances robustness against **model inversion** and **reconstruction attacks**.

### 4. Adaptive Privacy-Aware Regularization
- Dynamically adjusts **feature exposure** based on **privacy risk levels**.
- Prevents adversarial models from **extracting hidden private attributes**.

## Applications
- **Neuroprivacy Protection in BMI Systems**
- **Secure Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Applications**
- **Privacy-Preserving Neural Data Sharing**
- **Adversarial Defense against Neural Data Inference Attacks**
- **Ethical AI for Neuroscience and Cognitive Research**
